## About

SomeTrails is a clone of AllTrails where users can browse through parks and the trails within them to gather general information. On the home page, there is a photo slider that showcases some of the trails where users can click on the photo-card they are interested in. The user will be redirected to the trail page where they can look up general information of the trail such as directions, facilities, contact information, etc. Users will also be able to create, read, update, and delete reviews and also upload their own photos.

SomeTrails backend is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, PostgreSQL, AWS S3 storage for photos used in the frontend. The frontend is built using React, Redux, and SCSS. jQuery is used to send all AJAX calls from the frontend to the backend..
